This repository contains the homeworks from the course CENG371-Scientific Computing that I've done during 2023-2024 Fall semester.

The course covers a variety range of topics such as numerical accuracy, the sources and propagations of errors, algorithms for LU & QR factorizations, 
singular value decomposition (SVD), solutions of linear systems, linear least square problems (LLSQ), randomized linear algebra (RNLA) and low rank and compressed sensing.

# SHORT DESCRIPTION OF HOMEWORKS:

HW1: Numerical accuracy, accuracy and speed of summation algorithms (Naive, Compensated (Kahan), Pairwise)

HW2: Accuracy and speed of LU factorization algorithms (factorization without pivoting, with partial (row) pivoting, with complete (row + col) pivoting)

HW3: Singular value decomposition (SVD) of an image and comparison of several low rank approximation cases. Recovering a clean signal from a noisy one by using
normal equations and minimim least squares norm.

HW4: Approximating matrix matrix multiplication using RNLA methods (uniform sampling, non-uniform sampling, Gauss (random) projections, orthogonal Gauss (random) projections)
